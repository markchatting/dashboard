# Data_dashboard

Online dashboard that automatically updates with a shared database. Staff memebers update an online database and every time this script is run the dashboard automatically reads the databse and updates. A sample of the automatically generated data vizualizations is shown below. There is also a map component to the dashboard, where staff memebers enter GPS coordinates of unique events in the field and the map is automatically updated. I have removed the map, howver, as this would make public sensitive information.
